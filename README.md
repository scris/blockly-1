### Aditional Tips

- Once you have forked your own repository, you can makes as many commits, and push them to github, as you like. These will be pushed to your own repo and won't affect this shared repo. 
- Once you have issued a pull request any additional pushes you make to your repo will automatically update the pull request. This is like running gcl update multiple times for the same change list.
- Step 4 above is important to allow pull requests to be merged automatically, otherwise whoever reviews your code will have to merge, making them a sad panda.
